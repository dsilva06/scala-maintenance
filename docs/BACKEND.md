# Laravel Backend

The Laravel application is already checked into `backend/`. It ships with the
stock Laravel 11 skeleton plus a few project defaults:

- `.env` is pre-populated for local development and defaults to SQLite.
- `database/database.sqlite` is ignored so you can create the database locally
  without committing it.
- The root `Makefile` exposes wrappers for Composer, Artisan, and the dev
  server using Docker images (handy if you do not have PHP/Composer installed).

## First-time setup

Pick the workflow that matches your tooling.

### Option A: Docker-based tooling (recommended)

Requirements: Docker Desktop (or compatible engine) and `make`.

```bash
make backend-composer cmd="install"  # install PHP dependencies
make backend-key                       # generate APP_KEY in .env
```

You can now run Artisan, tests, or the dev server entirely through make:

```bash
make backend-serve                # serve at http://localhost:8000
make backend-artisan cmd="migrate"  # run database migrations
make backend-test                 # run PHPUnit feature/unit tests
```

### Option B: Native tooling

Requirements: PHP 8.2+, Composer 2, and Node 20+ for the Vite build step.

```bash
cd backend
composer install
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
php artisan serve --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8000
```

## Configuration notes

- The `.env` file defaults to SQLite and stores sessions/queues in the database.
  If you prefer MySQL/PostgreSQL, update the DB section and remove the
  `database/database.sqlite` file locally.
- Mail uses the `log` driver out of the box so no SMTP setup is required for
  local development.
- `SESSION_DRIVER` and `QUEUE_CONNECTION` are set to `database`. Run
  `php artisan queue:table` and `php artisan session:table` followed by
  `php artisan migrate` if you plan to use queues/sessions right away.

## Project structure

```
backend/
  app/            # Application code (controllers, models, jobs, etc.)
  bootstrap/      # Framework bootstrap files
  config/         # Configuration files
  database/       # Factories, migrations, seeders (plus local SQLite DB)
  public/         # Front controller and public assets
  resources/      # Blade views, language files, frontend assets
  routes/         # API & web routes
  storage/        # Logs, cache, compiled files (gitignored)
  tests/          # Feature & unit tests
```

## Common tasks

- Run a custom Artisan command:
  - Docker: `make backend-artisan cmd="your:command"`
  - Native: `php artisan your:command`
- Install additional Composer packages:
  - Docker: `make backend-composer cmd="require laravel/pint --dev"`
  - Native: `composer require laravel/pint --dev`
- Run the Pest test suite (`php artisan test`) instead of PHPUnit.

## Troubleshooting

- **`composer install` fails**: ensure Docker is running (if using the make
  targets) or that PHP/Composer are installed locally.
- **Database errors when using SQLite**: make sure the
  `database/database.sqlite` file exists and is writable by your user.
- **Port 8000 already in use**: stop the conflicting process or pass a
  different port, e.g. `make backend-artisan cmd="serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8001"`.

Happy building!
